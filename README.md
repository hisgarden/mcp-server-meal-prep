# MCP Server - Meal Prep (Rust)

A high-performance MCP (Model Context Protocol) server built in Rust for meal preparation, featuring cuisine-based recipes and intelligent meal planning capabilities.

## 🚀 Features

- **Multi-Cuisine Recipe Database**: Traditional recipes from French, Thai, Italian, Mexican, Chinese, and Vietnamese cuisines
- **Intelligent Meal Planning**: Generate weekly meal plans with optimized shopping lists
- **Ingredient Overlap Analysis**: Minimize food waste by identifying common ingredients
- **Resource Templates**: Dynamic recipe access via `file://recipes/{cuisine}` URIs
- **High Performance**: Built with Rust for excellent performance and memory safety
- **Type Safety**: Compile-time guarantees with zero-cost abstractions

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Rust Implementation Benefits

- **Memory Safety**: No null pointer exceptions or memory leaks
- **Performance**: Near C-level performance with excellent concurrency
- **Type System**: Powerful compile-time type checking
- **Macro System**: Code generation for MCP protocol compliance
- **Async Runtime**: Tokio-based async/await for high throughput

### Project Structure

```

```

### Development

```sh
# Run in development mode
cargo run

# Run tests
cargo test

# Check code formatting
cargo fmt

# Lint the code
cargo clippy
```

## 🎯 Available Features

### Tools

1. **`get_cuisines`**: List all available cuisines
2. **`get_recipes`**: Get recipes for a specific cuisine
3. **`generate_meal_plan`**: Create a meal plan with shopping list
4. **`analyze_ingredient_overlap`**: Find common ingredients across recipes

### Prompts

## 📋 Usage Examples

### MCP Client Configuration

Add to your MCP client configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "meal-prep": {
      "command": "/path/to/mcp-server-meal-prep/target/release/mcp-server-meal-prep",
      "args": [],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

### Example Tool Calls

```rust
// Get available cuisines
get_cuisines()

// Get French recipes
get_recipes({ "cuisine": "French" })

// Generate 7-day meal plan for Italian cuisine
generate_meal_plan({ 
  "cuisine": "Italian", 
  "days": 7, 
  "servings": 4 
})

// Analyze ingredient overlap for Mexican cuisine
analyze_ingredient_overlap({ "cuisine": "Mexican" })
```

### Example Prompt Usage

```rust
// Weekly meal planner for Indian cuisine
weekly-meal-planner({ "cuisine": "Indian" })
```

```

## 📊 Performance Characteristics

- **Startup Time**: ~10-50ms (compiled binary)
- **Memory Usage**: ~10-30MB baseline
- **Throughput**: Excellent for CPU-intensive meal planning
- **Latency**: Minimal overhead for recipe access

## 🔧 Development

### Adding New Cuisines

1. Edit `src/recipes.rs`
2. Add new recipes to the `get_recipe_database()` function
3. Rebuild: `cargo build --release`
4. Restart MCP client

### Adding New Tools

1. Add tool function to `MealPrepServer` implementation
2. Use `#[tool(description = "...")]` attribute
3. Implement error handling with `McpError`
4. Add tests for the new functionality

### Adding New Prompts

1. Add prompt function to `MealPrepServer` implementation
2. Use `#[prompt(name = "...")]` attribute
3. Return `GetPromptResult` with messages
4. Add argument validation

## 🚀 Deployment

### Building for Production

```sh
# Build optimized release binary
cargo build --release

# The binary will be at:
# target/release/mcp-server-meal-prep
```

### Cross-Platform Compilation

```sh
# Install cross-compilation target
rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu

# Build for Linux from macOS
cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build Errors**: Ensure Rust 1.70+ is installed
2. **Runtime Errors**: Check that all dependencies are available
3. **MCP Connection**: Verify the binary path in client configuration
4. **Permission Issues**: Ensure the binary is executable

### Debug Mode

```sh
# Run with debug logging
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run
```
